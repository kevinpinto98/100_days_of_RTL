# 100 Days RTL Challenge

This repository documents my journey of 100 days for learning System Verilog and UVM. I was inspired to take up this challenge after reading a [linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/raulbehl_100daysofrtl-100daysofrtl-verilog-activity-6941643220841828352-oBlD/?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web) by [Rahul Behl](https://github.com/raulbehl/100DaysOfRTL).

From 01/07/2022 to 08/10/2022 I shall implement one RTL design and it's corresponding testbench daily using System Verilog and UVM (wherever possible) respectively.

## RTL Designs Implemented:
* Day 1: Multiplexer
* Day 2: D Flip-flop
* Day 3: Edge Detector
* Day 4: 4-bit Counter
* Day 5: Finite State Machine
* Day 6: Clock Divide-by-3
* Day 7: Shift Register
* Day 8: Binary-to-Gray Converter
* Day 9: Gray-to-Binary Converter
* Day 10: 4-bit Adder-Subtractor Circuit
* Day 11: A Simple ALU
* Day 12: Sequence Detection
* Day 13: Priority Arbiter
* Day 14: Round-robin Arbiter
* Day 15: APB Master
* Day 16: Memory Interface
* Day 17: APB Slave
* Day 18: Parameterized FIFO
* Day 19: Register File
* Day 20: 4-bit Serial Adder
