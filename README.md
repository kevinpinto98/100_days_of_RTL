# 100 Days RTL Challenge

This repository documents my journey of 100 days for learning System Verilog and UVM. I was inspired to take up this challenge after reading a [linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/raulbehl_100daysofrtl-100daysofrtl-verilog-activity-6941643220841828352-oBlD/?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web) by [Rahul Behl](https://github.com/raulbehl/100DaysOfRTL).

From 01/07/2022 to 08/10/2022 I shall implement one RTL design and it's corresponding testbench daily using System Verilog and UVM respectively.
